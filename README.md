Mobile product documentation Camera station

This is the next iteration of the mobile Camstation that we worked with Kevin Loney to create something that we could:

 1. Roll down a store's isle
 2. Take a product and
	 1. Scan it (barcode / etc)
	 2. Confirm its database details
	 3. Photograph it
	 4. Weigh it
	 5. Dimension it
 3. Save the data to a database for inclusion to the Solarbotics.com website
 
 This is well documented on the Solarbotics' internal wiki at
