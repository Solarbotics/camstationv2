Mobile product documentation Camera station

This is the next iteration of the mobile Camstation that we worked with Kevin Loney to create something that we could:

 - Roll down a store's isle
 - Take a product and
	 3. Scan it (barcode / etc)
	 4. Confirm its database details
	 5. Photograph it
	 6. Weigh it
	 7. Dimension it
 
 This is well documented on the Solarbotics' internal wiki at 
 - http://192.168.2.8/index.php/camstation-v2-development-list/ and
